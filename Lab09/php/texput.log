\def \body^^M
{This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552. ^^M

^^M
I request that copies of the following documents be provided to me:^^M
^^M
\begin{enumerate}^^M
	\item  Any and all documents pertaining to the use of subliminal stimuli^^M
	({\it e.g.} embedded images or words, ^^M
	low-intensity light or sound, tachistoscopic displays) in ^^M
	advertising, government operations, or other fields.^^M
	^^M
	\item  Any and all documents pertaining to companies or organizations^^M
	that create, distribute, or sell subliminal material (including but not^^M
	limited to Osman-Kord, Ltd. (Southern California), Proactive^^M
	Systems (Portland, Oregon), and Stimutech, Inc. (East Lansing,^^M
	Michigan)).^^M
	^^M
	\item Any and all documents pertaining to laws, statutes, regulations,^^M
	or legal cases concerning subliminal stimuli.^^M
	^^M
	\item Any and all documents pertaining to the effectiveness ^^M
	or non-effectiveness of subliminal stimuli.^^M
\end{enumerate}^^M
^^M
I realize that the law may allow your agency to withhold specified ^^M
categories or exempted information, but would like to remind you that it ^^M
also requires you to release any segregable'' portions that are left over ^^M
after exempt material is deleted.  Please also provide me with the name of ^^M
the official to which administrative appeals should be directed.  If this ^^M
request for documents is denied, I would like to receive a detailed ^^M
justification for denial.^^M
^^M
I request a waiver of all fees for this request.  Disclosure of the ^^M
requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely ^^M
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or ^^M
activities of corporations, the government, and the media, and is not ^^M
primarily in my commercial interest.  I plan to make this information ^^M
available over the internet; this will benefit the general public because ^^M
the news media does not often report on this subject and the information I ^^M
will make available will be an important resource for those who are ^^M
concerned that subliminal messages may be in use (and will perhaps put to ^^M
rest many questions as to the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of such ^^M
material).  It would thus be unfair to make the first requester bear the ^^M
full cost of the initial search for these documents.  To further determine ^^M
my status to assess fees, you should know that I am affiliated with an ^^M
educational institution, and this request is made for a scholarly purpose ^^M
and not for a commercial use.^^M
^^M
Thank you for your consideration of this request.}^^M
